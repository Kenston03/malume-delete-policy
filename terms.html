  <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
  <p>Effective Date: June 17, 2025</p>

  <p>Welcome to Malume. These Terms and Conditions (“Terms”) govern your use of the Malume mobile application (“App”) provided by Anthem Technologies (“we”, “us”, or “our”). By downloading, accessing, or using the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms.</p>

  <h2>1. Purpose of the App</h2>
  <p>The App is designed to help parents track their children's transport in real time, communicate with assigned drivers, and manage trip-related details.</p>

  <h2>2. No Guarantee of Safety</h2>
  <p>The App is a digital tool intended to improve communication and visibility into transport operations. <strong>We do not guarantee the safety of children during transit or at any point before, during, or after a trip.</strong> The responsibility for ensuring the physical safety of a child remains entirely with the parent/guardian and transport provider.</p>

  <h2>3. Limitation of Liability</h2>
  <p><strong>We are not liable for any damages, injuries, losses, or accidents—including but not limited to bodily harm or death—that may occur during transportation, due to app failure, GPS inaccuracies, or misuse of the service.</strong></p>

  <p>By using the App, you acknowledge that all data provided is for informational purposes only, and may be delayed, inaccurate, or unavailable due to technical or network issues.</p>

  <h2>4. User Responsibilities</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You agree to use the App lawfully and responsibly.</li>
    <li>You will not use the App to harass, threaten, or exploit others.</li>
    <li>You are solely responsible for the data you submit, including names, contact information, and trip edits.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Communication</h2>
  <p>Parents and drivers can communicate through pre-defined or text-based alerts. Abuse of this system, including harassment, spam, or threats, may result in permanent account suspension.</p>

  <h2>6. Data Usage and Privacy</h2>
  <p>The App may collect limited information such as location data, device IDs, and trip activity. <strong>We do not sell or share any user or child-related data to third parties.</strong></p>

  <p>Data may be retained for operational purposes (e.g., trip history) but will be handled according to our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

  <h2>7. Service Availability</h2>
  <p>We do not guarantee continuous availability of the App. The service may be interrupted due to maintenance, network outages, or unforeseen technical issues.</p>

  <h2>8. Modifications</h2>
  <p>We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. Continued use of the App following any changes implies acceptance of the new Terms.</p>

  <h2>9. Termination</h2>
  <p>We may suspend or terminate your access to the App at our discretion, especially in cases of misuse or violation of these Terms.</p>

  <h2>10. Governing Law</h2>
  <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of South Africa. Any disputes arising out of or related to these Terms shall be resolved in the appropriate courts of South Africa.</p>
